# mIRC Twitch Bot
A Twitch Bot developed using mSL in mIRC. Features are currently being worked on.

# Required Items
* mIRC: Preferrably v7.43 or higher
* Windows XP+: This requires SReject's JSON Parser. [SReject's Github](https://github.com/SReject/mTwitch)
* [JSONformIRC.mrc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SReject/mTwitch/master/resources/JSONForMirc.mrc) Many parts of my aliases take advantage of this parser made by SReject to connect to Twitch's Web API.

# Installing
1. Download the scripts you like.
2. Move scripts to folder of choosing.
3. Inside mIRC Press `Alt` + `R` and release both.
4. Click `File` > `Load`
5. Select scripts and then click `Open`
6. If any boxes pop up asking to run initialization commands, click `OK`

# Notes
* Many scripts save data as .ini and .txt files.
* Many of these scripts reference folders called `data\Commands\` and other various iterations.
* These scripts were made for multi-channel use, and if you're running them on a personal account, please be way on joining other Twitch channels as they may not like "a bot" running in their channel.
